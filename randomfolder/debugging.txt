    1. Use of break statement whenever necessary.
2. Make a base case during recursion.
3. Visualize the code in you mind how is it running and everything
4. Never use concatenation inside loop ,tle happens
5. Use curly braces for if else always!
6. Always check with the edge cases(maximum and minimum value)!
7. Formatting issue or using modulo on double variable
8. Take a test case which covers all the functionality of code.
9. Never use built in pow function 
10. GO through the debugging checklist of Algozenith.
11. Always dry run code with strong test case.
12. Never typecaste double to int instead of this use floor or ceil function.
13. Use rand() function to generate test case.
14. To convert integer to char add '0' to integer and store it in char.
15. Never play with double variable like finding its digits after decimal or applying condion 
    on floating point it won't work most of the time due to floating point accuracy issue.
16. Storing double variable in string using to_string function is saved at differently means it is saved to different no 
    of significant digits while the double varible saved it to different no of significant digits!.
17. Use long long in place of int always !!!!!!!!!!
18. Never compare integer to double varible to check whether it is floating point of not
 in place of this use condition whether the mod is equal to zero or not !!!!!    
19. Don't create vector of large size like 1e18 with datatype long long or int as it will give
    error like bad_alloc!  
20. Always return value from a non void function.
21. Always use cin.ignore() before taking string as an input to avoid \n to terminate the cin>>str ,
\n is caused while taking int,double,char as an input!
22. Use cout flush whenever necessary and avoid using endl as it explicitly flush \
23. Run time error can also be caused if defining the large size array of 10^10
