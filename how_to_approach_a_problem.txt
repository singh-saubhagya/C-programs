Step 1: Understand the problem: read it more, use test cases to understand. 2 mins
Step 2: Find out the core of the problem. 5 mins

Most time consuming steps: 30 mins
Step 3: Use pen and paper and design an approach ,  which fits the constraints, use classifier,and run on the best test case .
Step 4: Now if you have build the logic according to the constraints, its time to formulate, Formulate means ,how 
are you going to structure you code based on the logic which you have build , take 2 - 3 mins.

Spend more time on the above steps so that you , don't need to chagne the logic behind your code.


Step 5: Start coding , Think of base cases if any , and add it : 20 mins
Step 6: Debugging , 10 mins


Habits:
-Always write base case for n=1 , n=0 
-Think in right dn quickly
-Look into constraints and then build logic
-Extract the core of the problem
